# HamletIDs
Generates practice Hamlet IDs for the Middlesex junior english exam.

When prompted, enter the minimum number of lines the ID should contain. Based on practice ids handed out in class, I suggest around 4 lines. 
The program will randomly generate a passage ID from any character in Hamlet.

**How to check answers**: Use Ctrl + F on the text file to locate the passage in the text. Currently, the program itself can't provide the answer.

**Note**: The code is imperfect! Occasionally, the generated ID might not make sense or contain weird formatting. If that's the case, just generate a new ID.
